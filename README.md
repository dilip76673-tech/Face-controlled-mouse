# Face-controlled-mouse

# 👁️🖱️ Eye Controlled Mouse

A Python-based **Eye Controlled Mouse** system that allows users to control the mouse
cursor using **eye movements** detected through a webcam.  
This project is built using **Computer Vision** techniques and is especially useful
for accessibility and hands-free interaction.

## 📌 Project Overview
The Eye Controlled Mouse tracks the user's eyes in real time using a webcam.
Based on eye position and movement, it moves the mouse cursor on the screen.
The project demonstrates practical use of **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and **PyAutoGUI**.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Webcam captures live video feed  
2. Face and eye landmarks are detected using MediaPipe  
3. Eye position is calculated from landmarks  
4. Mouse cursor moves according to eye movement  
5. (Optional) Blink detection can be used for mouse clicks
